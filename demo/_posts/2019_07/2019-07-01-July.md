# 2019.07.09 #To-do

Today I tried to run Pampelmuse on the cluster 47 Tuc. For this I had to first correct the astrometry of the MUSE datacube. The Hugss hubble images in [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hugs/) are corrected so I just used [mpdaf](https://mpdaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to match both images and worked nicely. Unfortunately, it didn't work. For all the stars it could calculate the 'moments'. I am not sure what this error messages exactly means but could debugg it and could run INITFIT on this datacube. 




## To-do
- [ ] MUSE and Hugss Hubble shorts scripts under Misc.

I have been reading about how to get distances from Gaia parallax. There are some very interesting papers by Bailer-Jones et al 2018 [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10121.pdf) and Bailer-Jones 2015 [Estimating distances from parallaxes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02105.pdf)


Also there are two particulary interesting GitHub repository to code to do this. One for the paper [On the Gaia DR2 distances for Galactic Luminous Blue Variables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03298.pdf) Nathan Smith et al. 2012. [Gaia_distances](https://github.com/curiousmiah/Gaia_Distances) and also a [tutorial in R](https://github.com/ehalley/parallax-tutorial-2018). Bailer-Jones has a book on practical Bayesian Inference that maybe I should check.

Dr. Maccarone has a paper as co-author (Gandhi et al 2018) called [Gaia DR2 distances and peculiar Velocities for Galactic Black Hole Transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11349). They do something similar to calculate the distances from the parallaxes. They needed to calculate the length scale for the X-ray sources and also used other prior.

##DOLPHOT on WFPC2


Taken on 2005 with proposal id 10424

Downloaded the NGC 6752 since Cohn has a paper with X-ray and maybe we can see them with MUSE.

## To-do
- [ ] Fix Astrometry NGC6752.

# 2019.07.12


MUSE porposal for sure

## To-do

- [ ] Write about M22 star and telescopes
- [ ] Fit Halpha to all CVs.
- [x] Cross correlate the catalog from Piotto to the catalog of Anderson. This is under CMDM22 and NGC6397



 Calculate Halpha - R for Cvs and 10% less that that how much to see if visiblae.

High density lines for stellar classification

On the Github repo called ReducedMUSE2017 under the misc folder and CognCatalog in the notebook called TableCohn.ipynb I did the Halpha-R from the Cohn data. Can see it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/manuelmarcano22/ReduceMUSE2017/blob/master/misc/CohnCatalog/TableCohn.ipynb)

Talked to Anna and need to play with te sky and other parameters. After playing with them if still needed, I can contact Sebastian. I have his old data so I know how it should look like the stars. I need to learn how to classify automatiocally the stars. 

## To-do

- [ ] Rerun Pampelmuse with less stars and play with the parameters.
