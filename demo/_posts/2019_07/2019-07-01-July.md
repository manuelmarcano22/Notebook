# 2019.07.09 #To-do

Today I tried to run Pampelmuse on the cluster 47 Tuc. For this I had to first correct the astrometry of the MUSE datacube. The Hugss hubble images in [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hugs/) are corrected so I just used [mpdaf](https://mpdaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to match both images and worked nicely. Unfortunately, it didn't work. For all the stars it could calculate the 'moments'. I am not sure what this error messages exactly means but could debugg it and could run INITFIT on this datacube. 




## To-do
- [ ] MUSE and Hugss Hubble shorts scripts under Misc.
