# 2019.07.09 #To-do

Today I tried to run Pampelmuse on the cluster 47 Tuc. For this I had to first correct the astrometry of the MUSE datacube. The Hugss hubble images in [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hugs/) are corrected so I just used [mpdaf](https://mpdaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to match both images and worked nicely. Unfortunately, it didn't work. For all the stars it could calculate the 'moments'. I am not sure what this error messages exactly means but could debugg it and could run INITFIT on this datacube. 




## To-do
- [ ] MUSE and Hugss Hubble shorts scripts under Misc.

I have been reading about how to get distances from Gaia parallax. There are some very interesting papers by Bailer-Jones et al 2018 [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10121.pdf) and Bailer-Jones 2015 [Estimating distances from parallaxes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02105.pdf)


Also there are two particulary interesting GitHub repository to code to do this. One for the paper [On the Gaia DR2 distances for Galactic Luminous Blue Variables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03298.pdf) Nathan Smith et al. 2012. [Gaia_distances](https://github.com/curiousmiah/Gaia_Distances) and also a [tutorial in R](https://github.com/ehalley/parallax-tutorial-2018). Bailer-Jones has a book on practical Bayesian Inference that maybe I should check.

Dr. Maccarone has a paper as co-author (Gandhi et al 2018) called [Gaia DR2 distances and peculiar Velocities for Galactic Black Hole Transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11349). They do something similar to calculate the distances from the parallaxes. They needed to calculate the length scale for the X-ray sources and also used other prior.

##DOLPHOT on WFPC2


Taken on 2005 with proposal id 10424

Downloaded the NGC 6752 since Cohn has a paper with X-ray and maybe we can see them with MUSE.

## To-do
- [ ] Fix Astrometry NGC6752.

# 2019.07.12


MUSE porposal for sure

## To-do

- [ ] Write about M22 star and telescopes
- [ ] Fit Halpha to all CVs.
- [x] Cross correlate the catalog from Piotto to the catalog of Anderson. This is under CMDM22 and NGC6397



 Calculate Halpha - R for Cvs and 10% less that that how much to see if visiblae.

High density lines for stellar classification



# 2019.07.15

On the Github repo called ReducedMUSE2017 under the misc folder and CognCatalog in the notebook called TableCohn.ipynb I did the Halpha-R from the Cohn data. Can see it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/manuelmarcano22/ReduceMUSE2017/blob/master/misc/CohnCatalog/TableCohn.ipynb)

Talked to Anna and need to play with te sky and other parameters. After playing with them if still needed, I can contact Sebastian. I have his old data so I know how it should look like the stars. I need to learn how to classify automatiocally the stars. 

## To-do

- [ ] Rerun Pampelmuse with less stars and play with the parameters. 



# 2019.07.16


Started to read documentation regarding the software DOLPHOT to do photometry with Hubble. The data from NGC6397 in the filter F336W is with the WFPC2. Some useful information is here:


1-[What hubble wfpc2 suffixes mean](http://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/legacy/wfpc2/_documents/wfpc2_dhb.pdf)




##To-do

- [x]  Do regions from italians paper. How to do it [here](https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/ReduceMUSE2017/tree/master/misc/PallancaCatalog)


#2019.07.17


The repository for the DOLPHOT project with NGC6397 and the F336W filter is [here](https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/NGC6397F336W). It has the code to create the param file for dolhpot and the presteps required. Also here is an exposure as a fuction of tiome and can be see [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/manuelmarcano22/NGC6397F336W/blob/master/u9712005/ExposurevsDate.ipynb).

One very useful resource was this called [delphinus](https://github.com/jonathansick/delphinus). I used his code to create the param file. I will check how he reads the data from the dolphot output. 


A useful resource [here](https://paolobonfini.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/notes-dolphot-parameters/)


## Misc

This guy has a repo to work woth padova code https://github.com/jonathansick?tab=repositories

To work with apogee data maybe:

#2019.07.23


Proposal look M30

maybe focus on CVS and learn how to do the active binaries. AB


#2019.07.24

U18 light Curve
