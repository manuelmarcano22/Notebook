# 2019.07.09 #To-do

Today I tried to run Pampelmuse on the cluster 47 Tuc. For this I had to first correct the astrometry of the MUSE datacube. The Hugss hubble images in [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hugs/) are corrected so I just used [mpdaf](https://mpdaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to match both images and worked nicely. Unfortunately, it didn't work. For all the stars it could calculate the 'moments'. I am not sure what this error messages exactly means but could debugg it and could run INITFIT on this datacube. 




## To-do
- [ ] MUSE and Hugss Hubble shorts scripts under Misc.

I have been reading about how to get distances from Gaia parallax. There are some very interesting papers by Bailer-Jones et al 2018 [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.10121.pdf) and Bailer-Jones 2015 [Estimating distances from parallaxes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.02105.pdf)


Also there are two particulary interesting GitHub repository to code to do this. One for the paper [On the Gaia DR2 distances for Galactic Luminous Blue Variables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.03298.pdf) Nathan Smith et al. 2012. [Gaia_distances](https://github.com/curiousmiah/Gaia_Distances) and also a [tutorial in R](https://github.com/ehalley/parallax-tutorial-2018). Bailer-Jones has a book on practical Bayesian Inference that maybe I should check.

Dr. Maccarone has a paper as co-author (Gandhi et al 2018) called [Gaia DR2 distances and peculiar Velocities for Galactic Black Hole Transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11349). They do something similar to calculate the distances from the parallaxes. They needed to calculate the length scale for the X-ray sources and also used other prior.

Taken on 2005 with proposal id 10424

Downloaded the NGC 6752 since Cohn has a paper with X-ray and maybe we can see them with MUSE. Need to 

## To-do
- [ ] Fix Astrometry NGC6752.

MUSE porposal for sure

## To-do

- [ ] Write about M22 star and telescopes
- [ ] Fit Halpha to al
- [ ] Cross correlate the catalog from Piotto to the catalog of anderson



{% note Don't forget to take notes %}
 Calculate Halpha - R for Cvs and 10% less that that how much to see if visiblae.
