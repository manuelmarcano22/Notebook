<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09156.pdf">A new spin on LIGO-Virgo binary black holes</a></p>

<p>Conclusions: alternative labeling for the componentobjects of a compact binary system based on their spinsinstead of their masses. When modeling the distributions of spintilt angles,  we find that the configuration where all ofthe spins in the population are aligned with the orbitalangular momentum is excluded from the 90% credibleinterval, for both the mass and the spin sorting.e findthat the most-spinning object is consistent with havingextremal spin for the events that were already known toprefer nonzero spins, GW151226 and GW170729.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10005">Study of eclipses for Redback pulsar J1227−4853</a> To summarize, in this paper we report a detailed multi-frequency study of the eclipseproperties  for  PSR  J1227−4853.   In  addition  to  regular  eclipses  around  superior  conjunc-tion,  the  system  also  shows  evidence  of  excess  dispersion  and  flux  fading  around  inferiorconjunction.  Simultaneous studies of pulsed and continuum flux densities indicate flux re-moval possibly due to the cyclotron absorption rather than temporal smearing as the causeof eclipse, both for regular eclipse as well as for flux fading at inferior conjunction.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12110">AT2018kzr: the merger of an oxygen-neon white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole</a></p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11605">Demographics of triple systems in dense star clusters</a>. I didn’t know there were some triplets in GCs.</p>

<p>“The  system  in  question,  called  4U  1820-30,  is  locatednear the centre of the GC NGC 6624 and consists of alow-mass  X-ray  binary  with  a  NS  primary  and  a  WDsecondary, in orbit with a period∼685 s.  There is alsoa large luminosity variation for this system with a pe-riod of∼171 days, thought to be due to the presenceof  a  tertiary  companion  (Grindlay  et  al.  1988).   An-other  confirmed  triple  system  in  the  GC  M4  is  madeup of an inner binary comprised of a pulsar (PSR 1620-26) and a white dwarf, orbited by a substellar tertiary(Arzoumanian  et  al.  1996;  Rasio  et  al.  1995).   Thesesystems could be naturally explained by binary–binaryinteractions  involving  planetary  systems  in  dense  stellar environments” Grindlay (1988) first suggested it maybe.</p>

<p>Chou and Grindlay 2001 found in RXTE 171 day.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11591">Chandra’s X-ray study confirms that the magnetic standardAp star KQ Vel hosts a neutron star companion</a></p>

<p>There should be data but I cant find it. 
KQ Vel: KQ Vel is a binary star. The analysis of radial velocity variationsby Bailey et al. (2015) suggests a companion of around 2 solar mass
 Very bright in optical and south and NS or CV maybe.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01826.pdf">The April–June 2020 super-outburst of OJ 287 and its long-termmulti-wavelength lightcurve with Swift: binary supermassive blackhole and jet activity</a> by Komossa et. al.</p>

<p>It talks about OJ 287, small blazar at z=0.306 with data from 1891 that shows “it shows pronounced optical double-peaksevery 12 years”</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We find that the outburst is jet-driven and consistent with abinary SMBH model, where the disk impact of the secondary blackhole triggers an after-flare in form of time-delayed accretion activityon the primary which is then followed by an increase in jet emissionof the primary∼4 months later.</p>
