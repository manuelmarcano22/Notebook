## NGC 6121 (M4)

This cluster is mentioned in the Bonanos HST catalog of variables HCV. The proposal 12911 has a lot of datato try tro find binaries between 0.5 months and 15 years. The PI is Luigi Bedin. There is a paper in 2014 by Nascimbeni, V from the [M4 Core Project with HST](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.2381N/abstract) that search for variable in the primary field. aprox 24 d cadence, They did it with 589 (392-396s) F467M images



## NGC 6544

Few points. Only 12 in 2013, 8 in 2005 and 5 in 2000.


## NGC 6656 (M22)

There is a proposal [7615](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=7615) to do gravitational microlensing by Sahu. There are 41 observations in 3 fields near the core  at 3 day intervals.  In 2003 Pietrukowicz and Kaluzny did a search for variable stars in the central part of M22. [Paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AcA....53..371P/abstract). They searched in the F814W in one region. In F606W tehre are only 72i ein all fields and 24 in each field 



# 2020.02.04

There is an interesting paper on the close binaries on Apogee. By Price-Whelan and called [Close Binary Companions to APOGEE DR16 Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00014).
