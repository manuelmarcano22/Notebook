## NGC 6121 (M4)

This cluster is mentioned in the Bonanos HST catalog of variables HCV. The proposal 12911 has a lot of datato try tro find binaries between 0.5 months and 15 years. The PI is Luigi Bedin. There is a paper in 2014 by Nascimbeni, V from the [M4 Core Project with HST](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.2381N/abstract) that search for variable in the primary field. aprox 24 d cadence, They did it with 589 (392-396s) F467M images



## NGC 6544

Few points. Only 12 in 2013, 8 in 2005 and 5 in 2000.


## NGC 6656 (M22)

There is a proposal [7615](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=7615) to do gravitational microlensing by Sahu. There are 41 observations in 3 fields near the core  at 3 day intervals.  In 2003 Pietrukowicz and Kaluzny did a search for variable stars in the central part of M22. [Paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003AcA....53..371P/abstract). They searched in the F814W in one region. In F606W tehre are only 72i ein all fields and 24 in each field 


# NGC 6366 

There are 3 deep 1426 sconds exposure in F275W, in F336W and D438W.


# NGC 6752

There is a Proposal [5318](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=5318) that was to search for binaries with 396 WFPC2 images.

Last time observed was in 1999. In this [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...473L..31B/abstract) by Bailyn in 1996 they report the period of 2 CVs of 5.1 and 3.7 hours.

# NGC 5139 (Omega Cen)

There is a proposal [6821](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=6821). There were also two calibration missions in F336W in 2012 and 2011 with some very short exposure times of 350 s and 10s.

The PI was Philip Charles [6121](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=6121). They found a Periodic IV modulation of a double degenerate binary in this cluster. [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996MNRAS.282L..37H/abstract). They did aperture photometry. 

Fpr this cluster here is the table from this [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AcA....54...19P/abstract).

# NGC 6205 (M13

There is a Bailyn Proposal [8278](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=8278).

They wanted to do binary population. Pietrukowicz and Kalyzny in 2004 trie dto do variable from the archive. This is the dataset from this [paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AcA....54...19P/abstract) table. 

![](assets/M13NGC6712.png)

They detected 4 new variable.s In F555W tje are 12 newer data from 2000


# NGC 6717

There are data scatter 23 total in different filter. 


#NGC 6558


Not much data
ACS thare are 4 and two propietart

# NGC 6760

There are3 F439W data from 2001.

# NGC 5904 (M5)

In this paper [Stellar Populations and Variable Stars in the Core of the Globular Cluster M5](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998AJ....115..725D/abstract). Theys used 22 F336W exposures from 1993. They found 29 variables. 

Thera re newer F555W data in 2008. 4x400,6x100 and 14x10 seconds. 

# NGC 6541

In 1994 there are 14xF555W. They used thid ata to discovery an erupting Dwarf Nova in NGC 6624. [By Shara](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...473L..35S/abstract)

Here is that table fo data:
