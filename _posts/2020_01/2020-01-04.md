# 2020.01.04


Today I was able to get the lightcurve for some more know variables V20 I can get the period that Kaluzny et al. gets for the source. I could find a good period of CV2 or U19, nor for CV3 U17. But for CV4, there is a huge change in magnitude of one magtinude that maybe it is an eclipsed. By looking at the Phase dispersion minimization there are two interesting period to fold of 0.1326 days and half of. It is in the notebook and should ask. the larger is about 3.18 hours which it is just above the period gap. The other would be about 1.5912 hours.
