## Reduce Echelle

Trying to follow this [Tutorial](https://www.naoj.org/Observing/Instruments/HDS/specana2014.10e.pdf)


Start by reducing the standard [HIP81800](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=HD+151044). This one is a0306.fits in the data. 

1. First stepo is to create bias with imcombine
2. Apply this bias and create a0306b.fits. This image - bias.fits
3. No Dark correction.
4. No Masking bad pixels
5. No non-linearity correction
6. No cosmic ray rejection. This is High SNR hopefully
7. First extraction spectra

## ZTF and weird object SDSS J204259.71+152108.0


In the computer at work in the folder ARScorpi there is a ZTF with notebook and lightcurve data.


Search here for object and it is indeed in two fields of view of ZTF:

- It is also in Swift by looking in Vizier:
