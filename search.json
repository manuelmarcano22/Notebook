I could find a good period of CV2 or U19, nor for CV3 U17. But for CV4, there is a huge change in magnitude of one magtinude that maybe it is an eclipsed. By looking at the Phase dispersion minimization there are two interesting period to fold of 0.1326 days and half of. It is in the notebook and should ask. the larger is about 3.18 hours which it is just above the period gap. The other would be about 1.5912 hours.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20200110\">Fri, Jan 10</h3>\n\n<p>Also the outside sources of XMM some are two in Chandra. Maybe one is MSP, so … . HSt images might not see them that far.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20200114\">Tue, Jan 14</h3>\n\n<p>After talking to Dr. Maccarone he suggested to read on the topic of mass estimation by rotational broadening of absorption lines. I found this article called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05042\">Accuracy of the component mass estimationmethods in LMXB</a></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20200115\">Wed, Jan 15</h3>\n\n<p>Made the figures much biggers and fixed the estimation of the companion mass. For the future need to learn how to reduce Chandra data to see the periods are found with the ones in the optical. Also need to start searching for good clusters to do a follow up with Hubble. Need to read on CVs period and what they mean,. IF tey are nova like and aboove the period gap and what/. If I can fold on X-ray will depend on the counts that I get for each source. Also the clusters to try to find should have hopefully f336W data.</p>\n\n<p>Also for future to reduce the gaiaall data from ESO.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20200117\">Fri, Jan 17</h3>\n\n<p>The cross-corelation for all the three MUSE spectra with a template main sequence k star gave me around 160 km/s, which agrees closely with the MUSE team reported one. I tried with thte third observation we have and it gave me around 60 km/s.</p>\n\n<p>U21 didn’t seemed to have a nice eclipsed like U23. I have to learn X-ray data analysis.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20200131\">Fri, Jan 31</h3>\n\n<p>Write about Russell 1945 magnitude on elipsoidal modulations. The Knigge paper on AK09 in 2003 has some nice discussion on what they do with the FUV HST data. They discuss eclipse width constraint on inclination and mass ratio and cite Horne 1985 eclipse mapping paper.</p>\n"

      "content": "<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20191212\">Thu, Dec 12</h3>\n\n<p>Today I redid the first 20 images on DOLPHOT but only for chip 3. I have to check the output and if it worked then do it for all of chip 3.</p>\n\n<p>Also worked a bit on TESS data. Simone showed me how he extract his lightcurve. He has a gui to select the star and the background then substract, maybe the mean he said. I can do it manually with lightcurve:</p>\n\n<p>Here is a small sample for KL Dra: <a href=\"https://github.com/manuelmarcano22/TESSOutburst/blob/master/KL%20Dra.ipynb\">KL Dra</a>. There seem to be two outburst in sector 14, and maybe 3 in 17. Simone also saw it. There are more ways to detrend the TESS data and maybe I should look into that.</p>\n\n<p>Also today the NICER team published the first results on <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2041-8205/page/Focus_on_NICER_Constraints_on_the_Dense_Matter_Equation_of_State\">J0030+0451</a>. 7 long papers reporting their cool findings. One was that the magnetic field of the pulsar might not be as nice as thought. The two hot spots are in the same hemisphere in not a nice round shape. They propose two models. The amsterdam group and a group in maryland. Very cool</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20191213\">Fri, Dec 13</h3>\n\n<p>Today changed some parameters of the DOLPHOT because the run from yesterday still finds a lot of stars where there are none and can’t find the bright ones. Also tried to play with the lightkurve code to modify the BOkeh. At the end will just save the lightcurve generated to do the background and substraction. Will probably have a notebook on the modifications I did. Theonly way to read the index that I could found was to get it from a javascript window alert that is annoying if you have to select many.</p>\n\n<p>Also yesterday I was thinking on this paper and what it means if we get the HST data and maybe for ESO studenship project? <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01531\">Disentangling CV in Gaia’s HR-Diagram</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There was today a very cool article on microlensing events on omega cen to see the balck holes <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05701\"> Constraining Black Hole Populations in Globular Clusters using Microlensing: Application to Omega Centauri </a>. They did a MC simulation.</p>\n\n<p>Also Anna told me that she uses python photoutils and it can be very fast. So I should give it a try to <a href=\"https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">phoutils</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For the TESS KL Dra seems to be the one gaia source in the middle but it doesnt agree with the gaia ID from a paper on AM CVns in the gaia era. But the outburst are seen if I only get the lightcurve from that single point in the middle.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"201912126\">2019.12.126</h1>\n\n<p>I finally ran Dolphot with the non-drizzled image as the reference one but just one of the other exposures. This way ther is a lot of false detection by DOLPHOT, just by looking at the region file but all the very bright ones are there. This was not the case before. The first thing I did was to see if I can recover the data for U18. This run only 117 had a good astrometric flag, but still the peak at the same period as before was there and the same star.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"log-entry\" id=\"20191230\">Mon, Dec 30</h3>\n\n<p>I finished the U23 notebook. Now in the same notebook I can plot the CMD and the hst  images. Can’t really plot the huge region file of all the dolphot sources, but it is ok. Now it is super fast to find the close stars with the astropy functions. Using the phase dispersion minimization it is fairly esy to find the period by Kaluzny on U23. And also twice that one, but the period is very long so probably the shortest. There are like 125 good points in the light-curve. Now has to do for the rest of the CVs and plot them in BOkeh.</p>\n"

Have to ask Liliana on her AM CVns candidates in globular clusters and also look at the qLMXB on Globlular clusters. Maybe with the absroption line of the companion, if known, can get a radial velocity curve. There are some eclipsing LMXB on the cluster. If we know they are eclipsing then we know the inclination. Resolution of AO in MUSE is about 0.3”.</p>\n\n<p>Also we discussed the project I will work on with XMM-Newton data for AR Scorpi. He send me the proposal to my email. Also he put a poor wheater Gemini proposal to look for broad emission line. Broad meaning 400-500 km/s. With the XMM Newton data have to learn how to carefully characterize variability and spectral feautures. The spectrum should have some plasma emission lines, and we will see how flat it looks. It also apparently looked flat in the radio data. This ARSCOpi is radio white dwarf, pulsar.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Hubble survey of cluster M30 has a lot of Hubble data that was taken to study binaries.

As with the physical coordinate transformation the nondiagonal or rotation terms are not expected in the spectral WCS and may cause problems if they are not zero. The CTYPEi keywords will have the value LINEAR to identify the type of of coordinate system. The transformation between dispersion coordinate, wi, and logical pixel coordinate, li, along axis i is given by  wi = CRVALi + CDi_i * (li - CRPIXi)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding the defaults</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the keywords are missing then the values are assumed to be zero except for the diagonal elements of the scale/rotation matrix, the CDi_i, which are assumed to be 1. If only some of the keywords are present then any missing CDi_i keywords will take the value 0 which will cause IRAF tasks to fail with arithmetic or matrix inversion errors. If the CTYPEi keyword is missing it is assumed to be “LINEAR”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"boxcar-smooth\">Boxcar Smooth</h3>\n\n<p>IRAF very useful smooth function applies a boxcar smooth.

The only ploblem is that to generate the static html and js the widget I think needs to be written in JS and you have to pass a ColumnDataSource. One easy, but not efficient way is to create several Data sets. It does the work but could be more efficient.
