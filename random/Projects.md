## Echelle Spectrum


## NGC 3201

Chandra and XMM data with Hubble. 

there is HUGS data in F275 and other HST images in the archives a couple of Chandra point sources and a list of XMM sources by Natalie Webb with XMM-data.

- [ ] Identify the optical counter in hubble and CMD
- [ ] Get variability from stetson


## TESS Outbursts


- [ ] Get the KL Dra fit gaussian and identify maybe others.
